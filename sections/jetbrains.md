- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) --> `Java`

    Reasons to use **IntelliJ IDEA** for Java, instead of **BlueJ** :
        
    - **Auto-completion** of variable and method/function names when typing, very handy in **big projects**!

    - **Powerful de-bugging**, use of breakpoints to stop code execution and see code properties line-by-line.

    - **Easier project management** w/ Integrated Command Line Tool.
    
    - **Get ahead!** Thinking ahead to Year 2, we're all ushered away from BlueJ anyway!

    - **If you out grow BlueJ**, take the plunge and **UPGRADE** to **IntelliJ IDEA**.

        ```java
        String blueJ = "I help mainly with Year 1";
        String intelliJ = "Relax everbody, I'm here!";
        ```

- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) --> `C & C++`
